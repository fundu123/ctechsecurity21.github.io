    <h2><hr>
    Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.<hr>

  Cybersecurity vs. Computer Forensics<br><hr>
Let's start by what cybersecurity and computer forensics have in common: <br><br>both focus on the protection of digital assets and intelligence.<br><br> Individuals in both fields are employed in virtually all industries and sectors, from non-profit organizations to government entities to private corporations and enterprises - as more and more businesses recognize the importance of securing their systems and technologies, both cybersecurity and computer forensics professionals are finding their skills in high demand.<br><br>

However, the two professions are not synonymous. In fact, it's helpful to think of cybersecurity and computer forensics as two essential sides of the same coin - the work they do is very similar, but differs in a few key ways.
<br><br>
To put it simply, cybersecurity is about prevention, while computer forensics is about response. Or, in other words: the cybersecurity team works to implement and maintain a robust information security system, with the intention of defending an organization from cyber attacks; in the event that their efforts fail, and a breach is made, the computer forensics team works to identify the hack, understand the source, and recover compromised data. The two fields are highly reliant on one another to maintain ongoing network security for organizations across numerous industries and sectors.
